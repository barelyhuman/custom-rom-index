As an enthusiast, I’ve wasted hours together to find a working ROM
for my devices and also, sometimes I feel like it’s better to
spend on devices that already have a great collection of roms.
Which is why this website was created so you don’t have to waste
time like I did.

## Link

You can access all the devices at [https://cri.reaper.im](https://cri.reaper.im).
