As an enthusiast, I’ve wasted hours together to find a working ROM
for my devices and also, sometimes I feel like it’s better to
spend on devices that already have a great collection of roms.
Which is why this website was created so you don’t have to waste
time like I did.

## Link

You can access all the devices at [https://cri.reaper.im](https://cri.reaper.im).

## Contribute

If you wish to add more devices/ROMs to the list you can follow the steps [here](https://cri.reaper.im/submit-rom).

## Data Credits

While most of them are being added manually right now, we are using a lot of data from the open source repositories listed here,
they make it easier to handle syncing of data
